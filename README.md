# About Me

I am a backend engineer with more than three years of industry experience, specializing in building reliable, scalable, and maintainable web applications. My core expertise is in Python and Django, with hands-on experience delivering production-grade APIs, microservices, background processing pipelines, and full-stack features when required. I focus on clean architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability across all projects.

I have worked extensively with SQL databases, distributed task queues, containerized deployments, and modern DevOps workflows. I also collaborate closely with product teams to design efficient solutions and ensure smooth delivery from development to production.

# What I Do

• Design and develop backend systems and REST APIs using Django, Django REST Framework, and FastAPI  
• Build async-ready, scalable services with Celery, Redis, and background tasks  
• Implement secure authentication, role-based access, and optimized database queries  
• Containerize and deploy applications using Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, and Gunicorn  
• Work with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite for structured, efficient data storage  
• Deliver front-end features using Next.js when full-stack support is needed  
• Write clean, maintainable code with strong focus on testing and CI/CD  
• Collaborate effectively across teams and ensure high-quality delivery
